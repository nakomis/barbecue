     * <p>
     * The general contract of <code>hashCode</code> is:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     *     an execution of a Java application, the <tt>hashCode</tt> method
     *     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     *     used in <tt>equals</tt> comparisons on the object is modified.
     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the <tt>equals(Object)</tt>
     *     method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link Object#equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the <tt>hashCode</tt> method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
     * class <tt>Object</tt> does return distinct integers for distinct
     * objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
     * address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
     * technique is not required by the
     * Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> programming language.)
